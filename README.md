<h1> Schedule </h1>
<h2> An advanced lesson plan of the Krakow University of Technology, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, including a filtration option </h2>
<p> The application was created to be as simple as possible to use. An unlogged user only has the search option available.
  Then he has all 9 filters at his disposal to search for specific classes. The results are then displayed in a table.</p>

<p> The administrator also has the option to update the plan. The entire plan is downloaded from the SQL server. This option is only available after logging in with a specific login and password.
  Due to the fact that the application is online, this data is in the Connections class that is not shared. Data for connecting to the server is also in this class.</p>

<h2> Application is developed using following technologies: </h1>

<p>Since some of the classes are not on github, for security reasons, there is no option to easily launch the repository.
  The only option to test the app is from my website </p>

  <h2> Plans for the future </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Improve UI</li>
    <li> Add the ability to retrieve Google Calendar filtered data </li>
    <li> Add the ability to change data in SQL directly from the page </li>
  </ul>
